# Product Requirements Document: Data Resampling Feature

## Introduction/Overview

The Historify application currently downloads historical data in various timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 1d) but faces a limitation when users try to view timeframes that haven't been specifically downloaded. When 1-minute data is available but a user selects a different timeframe (e.g., 5m, 15m), the system displays "No data available" instead of intelligently resampling the existing 1-minute data.

This feature will implement automatic data resampling functionality that converts existing 1-minute OHLCV data into any higher timeframe when the specific timeframe data is not available, providing users with seamless chart viewing experience regardless of which timeframes have been explicitly downloaded.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate "No data available" errors** when 1-minute data exists but requested timeframe is missing
2. **Improve user experience** by providing automatic data conversion without manual intervention
3. **Reduce API calls** to OpenAlgo by leveraging existing 1-minute data for higher timeframes
4. **Maintain data accuracy** through proper OHLCV aggregation methods
5. **Ensure performance** through efficient caching mechanisms for resampled data
6. **Provide flexibility** for technical indicator calculations on resampled data

## User Stories

1. **As a trader**, I want to view 5-minute charts even when only 1-minute data is downloaded, so that I can analyze price action at different timeframes without waiting for additional downloads.

2. **As a data analyst**, I want the system to automatically convert my 1-minute data to higher timeframes, so that I can quickly switch between different chart intervals during my analysis.

3. **As a user with limited API quota**, I want to download only 1-minute data and have the system generate other timeframes, so that I can conserve my API calls while still accessing multiple timeframes.

4. **As a chart viewer**, I want to see a loading indicator when data is being resampled, so that I understand the system is processing my request rather than having no data.

5. **As a technical analyst**, I want to choose whether technical indicators are calculated on original 1-minute data or resampled data, so that I can ensure indicator accuracy based on my analysis methodology.

6. **As an API user**, I want to access resampled data through API endpoints, so that I can integrate this functionality into external applications.

7. **As a data exporter**, I want to export resampled data in various formats, so that I can use the converted timeframes in other analysis tools.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Resampling Engine

1. The system **must** implement a data resampling engine that converts 1-minute OHLCV data to higher timeframes (5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 1d)
2. The system **must** use standard OHLCV aggregation methods:
   - Open: First value in the timeframe
   - High: Maximum value in the timeframe  
   - Low: Minimum value in the timeframe
   - Close: Last value in the timeframe
   - Volume: Sum of all volume in the timeframe
3. The system **must** handle timezone considerations correctly when aggregating data
4. The system **must** validate data integrity before and after resampling

### Chart Integration

5. The system **must** automatically attempt resampling when a user selects a timeframe that has no direct data but 1-minute data exists
6. The system **must** display a loading indicator during resampling operations
7. The system **must** show a notification informing users that data is being resampled from 1-minute data
8. The system **must** update the chart seamlessly once resampling is complete

### Caching Mechanism

9. The system **must** implement temporary in-memory caching for resampled data to avoid repeated calculations
10. The system **must** set appropriate cache expiration times (suggested: 15 minutes for intraday, 1 hour for daily)
11. The system **must** invalidate cache when new 1-minute data is downloaded for the same symbol/period
12. The system **must** implement cache size limits to prevent memory overflow

### Fallback Behavior

13. The system **must** attempt to download 1-minute data first if no data exists for the requested symbol/period
14. The system **must** fall back to "No data available" message only when no 1-minute data can be obtained
15. The system **must** show partial resampled data if 1-minute data is available for only part of the requested time range

### Progressive Processing

16. The system **must** implement chunked resampling for large datasets (>10,000 data points)
17. The system **must** show progress indication for long-running resampling operations
18. The system **must** allow cancellation of long-running resampling processes

### API Integration

19. The system **must** provide API endpoints for programmatic access to resampled data:
    - `GET /api/resample/<symbol>/<exchange>/<from_interval>/<to_interval>`
    - `POST /api/charts/resample` (for bulk resampling requests)
20. The system **must** include resampling functionality in existing chart data API endpoints
21. The system **must** add resampling capability to data export functionality

### Technical Indicators

22. The system **must** provide user option to calculate technical indicators on:
    - Original 1-minute data then resample indicators
    - Resampled OHLCV data then calculate indicators
23. The system **must** maintain indicator accuracy regardless of chosen calculation method
24. The system **must** cache indicator calculations alongside resampled data

### Settings & Configuration

25. The system **must** add resampling settings to the application configuration:
    - Enable/disable automatic resampling
    - Default resampling method preference
    - Cache timeout settings
    - Maximum resampling dataset size
26. The system **must** allow users to configure technical indicator calculation preferences
27. The system **must** provide option to pre-calculate common timeframes during 1-minute data download

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Downsampling**: Converting higher timeframes to lower timeframes (e.g., 5m to 1m) - not mathematically possible without data loss
2. **Real-time resampling**: Live resampling of streaming data - focus is on historical data only
3. **Custom timeframes**: Non-standard intervals (e.g., 7m, 23m) - stick to standard trading timeframes
4. **Persistent storage**: Storing resampled data permanently in database - use caching only
5. **Cross-symbol resampling**: Combining data from multiple symbols - focus on individual symbol processing
6. **Advanced aggregation methods**: Custom OHLCV calculations beyond standard methods
7. **Tick data resampling**: Converting tick-by-tick data - only OHLCV minute data

## Design Considerations

### User Interface
- **Loading States**: Implement skeleton loading for charts during resampling
- **Notifications**: Toast notifications to inform users about resampling process
- **Settings Panel**: Add resampling preferences to Settings page
- **Progress Indicators**: Progress bars for large dataset resampling

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Only resample data when actually requested
- **Background Processing**: Use web workers for CPU-intensive resampling tasks

## Open Questions

1. **Timezone Handling**: How should the system handle different market timezones when resampling data? Should it use exchange-specific timezone or user preference?

2. **Partial Data Handling**: When 1-minute data has gaps (missing minutes), how should the resampled timeframes handle these gaps? Should they interpolate, skip, or mark as invalid?

3. **Memory Limits**: What should be the maximum dataset size allowed for resampling? Should there be different limits for different user types or system resources?

4. **Cache Persistence**: Should resampled data cache survive application restarts, or should it be purely in-memory?

5. **Indicator Priority**: For technical indicators, should there be different default calculation methods for different indicator types (e.g., volume-based vs price-based)?

6. **Batch Resampling**: Should the system support resampling multiple symbols simultaneously, and if so, how should progress and error handling work?

7. **Real-time Integration**: How should this feature integrate with future real-time data streaming capabilities?

8. **Data Quality**: Should the system validate 1-minute data quality before resampling (e.g., check for obvious errors, outliers)?

9. **Export Integration**: Should exported resampled data include metadata indicating it was generated through resampling rather than downloaded directly?

10. **API Rate Limiting**: Should resampling operations be subject to API rate limiting to prevent system abuse?
